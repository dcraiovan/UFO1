# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project was to learn how to take data that is stored as a JavaScript array or list and create a table to organize the information that will visually adjust as "events" change (i.e. filtering). In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. Finally, we use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic.

# Results


# Summary

Unfortunately, the page has several drawbacks. They include:

The search field is "case-sensitive". This is an issue because it does not intuitively tell the user how the information should be entered other than the "default" example shown.

There is no button to click, wording or action that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter".

The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

Recommendations for further development:

Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.

Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
